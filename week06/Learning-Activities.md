Problem 1
Implement Selection sort and Bubble sort and display the array being sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.

For example, if the array to be sorted is: [5, 1, 9, 6, 2]

Then, the Selection sort's intermediate results are

[5, 1, 9, 6, 2] (original state)

[1, 5, 9, 6, 2] (after the 1st iteration)

[1, 2, 9, 6, 5] (after the 2nd iteration)

[1, 2, 5, 6, 9] (after the 3rd iteration)

[1, 2, 5, 6, 9] (after the 4th iteration)

Problem 2
The RMIT logo contains red and white as its two main colors. 
Given a connected graph G, your task is to color the vertices using red and white such 
that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Implement an algorithm to check whether this coloring condition can be satisfied for a given connected graph G.

Problem 3
Given an array V storing the values of N items, an array W storing the weights of N items,
and a knapsack capacity C. Calculate and return the subset of N items that has the highest sum value, 
and its total weight does not exceed C.

Problem 4
Solve the 8-queens problem. Can you use pruning to reduce the number of computations?
