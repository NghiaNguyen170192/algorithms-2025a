Problem 1

Implement the pre-order, post-order, in-order, and breadth-first traversals for a binary search tree.

Problem 2

Given the root of a binary tree, check if the tree is a binary search tree.

Problem 3

Given a node in a binary tree, calculate its level (assume the root level is zero). Apply this result to calculate the
distance between two nodes (i.e., the distance between nodes A and B is the minimum number of edges to go from A to B).

Problem 4

Given a binary search tree and a value X, return the node containing the minimum value Y in the tree such that Y >= X.
If no such value exists, return null.
