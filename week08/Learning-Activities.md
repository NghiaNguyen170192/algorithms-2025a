Problem 1
Implement Merge sort and Quick sort.

Generate an array of 1,000,000 random integers and use Merge sort and Quick sort to sort it. Compare the running between them.

Can you use Selection sort or Bubble sort to sort an array of this size?

Problem 2
Problem 2A: Convert a sorted array into a balanced BST.

A reminder: a balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depths of the two subtrees of every node differ by no more than 1.

Problem 2B: Convert a sorted linked list into a balanced BST (you are not allowed to convert the list into an array first).

Problem 3
Given an array of integers A. Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion when

i < j AND A[i] > A[j]
